## About Me

I'm a second-year graduate student pursuing a Master's in <b>Computer and Information Technology at Purdue University</b>, West Lafayette. 

I am a member of the <b>Responsible Data Science (RDS) Lab</b>, where my thesis work focuses on Explainable AI with Dr. Romila Pradhan. I have also been working as a Graduate TA for the last 3 semsters: CNIT 323: Basic Cyberforensics, CNIT 392: Enterprise Data Management and CNIT 175: Intoduction to Visual Programming.

Over the summer of 2025, I did an internship at <b>Leen</b>, as a <b>Data Science Intern</b>, where I worked on building integrations for security platforms.
I previously worked as a <b>Software Engineer at Palo Alto Networks</b> in Bengaluru for a year in the Next Generation Firewall team, working on automation of testing workflows and adding API's to interact with the Panorama and Firewall devices. I have also completed two other internships: one at Nasdaq, in the Enterprise Blockchain team and the other at Palo Alto Networks in the same team, before I joined as a full-time employee.

I am a classically trained Hindustani Classical vocalist, and I was in a band called *Tin Pan Alley* in my undergrad. I also love watching movies and travelling.

On this site I keep a list of my [publications](papers.qmd), [projects](#projects), and my [resume](/resume.pdf), as well as a [technical blog](blog_landing.qmd).
