    "text": "Why Explainable AI Matters\nMachine learning models, especially deep neural networks, often operate as “black boxes.” While they can achieve impressive performance, understanding their decision-making process remains challenging. This lack of transparency can be problematic in:\n\nHealthcare decisions\nFinancial services\nLegal systems\nSecurity applications"
